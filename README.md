# Study Buddy Tinder 
Group project for CPSC 481 (Human Computer Interactions I)

## Stage 1
* Study Buddy Tinder (name pending) is a way for students to be able to connect with other students and find peers to study with. Students may broadcast and join ongoing study sessions, as well as filter their search based on classes that they are currently enrolled in.
* Map feature - Interactive map in which students can see ongoing sessions where they currently are on campus. Students will also be able to see density of zones such as the library or the cafeteria, so they have a general idea of how hard it will be to find a spot before they reach the destination.
* Chat with your buddies! - Students will be able to DM each other, as well as send a chat to groups that are being broadcast. If you are part of a session, you can transfer files to one another as well
