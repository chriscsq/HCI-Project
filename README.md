# Study Buddy Tinder 
Group project for CPSC 481 (Human Computer Interactions I)

## Stage 1

#### Introduction
* Study Buddy Tinder (name pending) is a way for students to be able to connect with other students and find peers to study with. Students may broadcast and join ongoing study sessions, as well as filter their search based on classes that they are currently enrolled in.
* Map feature - Interactive map in which students can see ongoing sessions where they currently are on campus. Students will also be able to see density of zones such as the library or the cafeteria, so they have a general idea of how hard it will be to find a spot before they reach the destination.
* Chat with your buddies! - Students will be able to DM each other, as well as send a chat to groups that are being broadcast. If you are part of a session, you can transfer files to one another as well

## Stage 2

#### Overview 
Study buddy tinder is a project that focuses on students' ability to meet with other students with the same academic interests. The main features of Study buddy tinder are its broadcasting capabilities, the interactive map, and the messaging system with file transfer. Students have the option of either registering a profile or visiting as a guest. As a guest, students only have the ability to use our universal search feature to find ongoing study sessions and request to join. If students choose to create a student profile, they have access to broadcast ongoing sessions, schedule future sessions, add other profiles to friends, send files to groups or other users. In being able to broadcast and join study sessions, students are able to meet others who are taking the same classes as them, making it easier to meet people. This would come in handy during midterm season, where peer tutoring is high. When registering for a profile, a user can request to be a tutor as well. Tutors will also be able to use the system to advertise their services, which will be shown to students on a tutoring page. This is an easy way to collect tutoring services to students who desire a little bit more of a professional touch, without them having to reach out and look for the correct flyers on campus. Lastly, prep institutions have the ability to contact us to create an account with limited functionality so they can advertise their sessions. A prep institution will be allowed to advertise their future prep sessions on the map. Prep accounts have highly limited functionality, where they can only create future accounts and as well as have open messages in case of student inquiries. Students who see the prep session on the map can click on it and choose to hide graphic, or to register for the session. 

#### IDEO Methods
* To gauge user interest, we chose to survey the Univeristy of Calgary subreddit. This survey provided us with the information that despite most people studying alone, they are open to the idea of meeting with new peers. In addition, students are already comfortable with using forms of technology to communicate with other students (Reddit, Slack, Discord etc), introduction to an app would not shock the culture.

* To get more detailed data, we also gave a more in depth interview to see how their studying habits have changed since University. After learning a bit more, we offered these students 3 scenario cards which depicted 2 traditional scenes of finding new study partners, and one scene which involved the use of our app. We asked them what features seemed the most interesting to them, and the general consensus was the ability to build an academic social network with an interactive map appealed most of them.

#### Reflection of IDEO Methods 
For our user research methods, we chose 3 IDEO methods to gather information.
* Surveys
* Interviews
* Scenario Card Testing

Using Surveys allowed to cover a broad category of students that other methods simply could not capture. Through using them we were able to elicit a large amount of data, (111 responses in fact) worth of data. Although the data may not all be incredibely in-depth, it gives us a general start location for where our potential application stands in relation to our students. 

In order to further pin-point our ideas, we used our interviews to dig to the centre of our users. Where as the Survey was a more surface level analysis, the interviews got straight into the meat of the content, asking the users for things such as their personal study habits and how they may have evolved or changed. We believe that the use of Survey and Interviews in tandem are perfect because, as previously stated, Surveys cover a large and broad category of knowledge that we need, but interviews are able to really get down to ground level and help us to understand our users eye to eye. 

Finally, using Scenario Cards we are able to show the users what our core functionality ideally would look like in practice. This in return helped us during interviews because as users could sort of have an idea of what the end product was like, they would be able to give a more informed opinion regarding the situation. 

To answer a broad selection of questions we surveyed the r/UCalgary subreddit to learn more about student behaviour. Out of 111 responses, here are our findings. When asked if students prefer to study alone or in a group, an overwhelming 73.9% stated that they prefer to study alone. We also wanted to see if these students were also open to studying with other peers, and we were surprised to find that 70% of students trended towards being open towards studying with peers. Even though these students are used to studying alone, we concluded that it might not always be out of choice. We also gathered information on students’ use of technology. Firstly, we asked if the students currently use technology or social media to coordinate with peers in their class. Our results from these findings were 79.3, which displays that these students are already comfortable with using these external resources to coordinate with peers. To follow up, we found out only 52% of these students were interested in an app that helps you find other students to study with. Since our numbers led us to believe that there would be more interest, we decided that combining both scenario cards and interviews both the students and us a deeper understanding of each others goals. During our interviews, we really tried to focus on our individuals study habits were. We realized that a lot of students were interested in the social aspect of our functionalities. Upon showing our scenario card which had a rough prototype of the UI, interviewees responded well to the large map but wanted to build into the profile features more, akin to LinkedIn. Most of our results showed that students met other peers in class, or through mutual friends. This all aligned with our survey results, where people were less interested in the idea of having app that helps them meet study buddies, but they were heavily interested in studying with more peers.

#### Task Descriptions
* Given a user is signed in, allow said user to access their courses. Based on course selection allow the user to view or create study groups.

* Given a user is not signed in, allow user to sign into the app by providing their university email. This will give them access to features that will allow them to connect to other prospective study buddies.

* Given a user is signed in, allow the user to successfully locate less busier locations to study around campus. This can be done using the in app map which shows areas where the concentration of students is high/low.

* Given a user is signed in, show the user, on the map, locations for potential study groups ongoing for the courses they are enrolled in. if they are interested in any of these, they may join the study group virtually via the app or simply make their way to the location on the map and meet up with their fellow study buddies.

* Given a user account that differs (Tutor/TA/etc) from the norm (Student), generate a different flow with different accessibility to features of the app. For example, allow tutors to set up open prep sessions that students from all areas can join.

* Given a user is signed in, allow said user to set up filters for their study preferences (quiet area, open discussion, etc). Based on those study preferences allow the user to search through a database of other students that share similarities.

* Given a user is signed in, allow said user to get in touch with other users in their network (same classes/faculty/etc) via direct messaging.

## Stage 3

#### Summary of issues identified by task-centered walkthrough
Through our task-centered design walkthrough we have identified a few issues with our design. We have realized that we currently do not have a way to add other users add friends unless this is done through a study group. Through this process we have discovered that we may have been neglecting the social aspect of the app. We also realized that we have a majority of our actions on the map itself, which may cause points confusion and may lead to a suboptimal user experience. Through a high fidelity prototype, we wish to explore how the actions taken on the map actually feels, and if our solution to swipe left and introduce a screen serves its purpose to declutter. 

#### Promising Ideas
##### Bitmoji avatars
Since the premise of the app is to offer a social experience in academics, using Bitmoji for profile images allows for a neutral way of displaying yourself to the world. Since they are a caricature of yourself, it aids users in finding people they’re meeting for the first time. The use of Bitmojis over profile pictures allow more privacy for users who do not wish to upload a picture of themselves, and takes away any bias people might have in finding peers to study with. Bitmojis also provide a little bit of a more fun experience for the user.
##### Filtering
With filtering, we’ve included the ability to create entire Terms for users to filter by. If you have an active term selected as a filter, that term will be reflected in your public profile so others may also see what you’re looking to study for that term. Having the ability to create pre-set terms allows for the user to get information thats only relevant to them. If users choose not to filter by a term, they can also add classes to filter individually, or even add additional classes they wish to filter by along with their term. These filters will be applied visually to the map as well as the list view of groups which are broadcasting study sessions. 
##### Density heat map
As groups are studying in certain areas, members will be notified to answer a quick prompt if they wish to rate the density of the area around them. They will get options like “(a) Lots of room available (b) Little study room (c) No study room”. We’ll use this crowd sourced data gathered by members in certain areas to visualize how busy an area is on the map. Since it’s just one quick question that users have benefited from themselves and it doesn’t take much effort, students will be motivated to help each other out. 


#### Reflection
We opted to do sketches separately and then come together at a later time to share the sketches, so each member would have an opportunity to display their vision of what the app should look like and how it should function. Although this was good because we were able to gather a variety of ideas, finding common ground between our ideas and selecting the right idea became a difficult process. After our brainstorming session, we attempted to create a low-fi prototype that we could all agree on to display our core functions. Our ideas were a bit scattered on what we thought was core, so we decided to go back and analyze user feedback. Since we gathered feedback through surveys and interviews in Stage two, we used the data gathered to assist in creating an affinity diagram where we then listed the strengths and weaknesses of the features that people wanted. This allowed us to set our biases aside, and to focus on the features that were most strongly requested by users and relevant to our apps functionality. Once we were able to get a core idea of what features we wanted highlighted, it became easier for us to prioritize these in our interface. For future iterations, we’ll take in consideration what we learned from gathered feedback and build off the data we analyzed first rather than using them as a form of confirmation bias.

## Stage 4

#### Overview
Initially we provided group 3.5 with some information about our app and gave them the initial high fidelity prototype for them to conduct a heuristic evaluation. We provided the evaluators with some knowledge to help in their evaluation of the app. After receiving the evaluation results, we then applied severity ratings to all the feedback points and after a debriefing with the team we decided to group them into three categories; Fix before stage 4 deadline, fix before stage 5 deadline, and considerations for future projects. 

#### Severity
The levels of severity go as follows:
0 - Don’t think this is a usability problem.
1 - Cosmetic problem
2 - minor usability problem
3 - major usability problem; important to fix
4 - Usability catastrophe; must fix

In some cases we had already implemented the features the evaluator was looking for, in those cases we applied the severity ratings as if we didn’t complete them. For example, an evaluator wanted a login page, which had already been implemented, in this case the severity would be 4, as it would be a major issue if the claim was true. 

#### Important Problems to be fixed before stage 4 deadline
The app should implement a Signup and Login page, this would allow for a more clear of the starting point of the app and a better flow while exploring the app. However, we have already implemented both of these pages, it seems the evaluator had missed these pages. The idea for the app is to allow the user to explore the app freely and only be required to login when they desire to use certain features.  - Severity Rating: 4
Searching for new friends and sending friend requests to them is an important feature required in social apps. We plan on implementing this right away. - Severity Rating: 2
In the notifications, it can be seen when a friend is broadcasting an event. The ability to join the session from that notification would very useful and would allow for higher efficiency when navigating through the app. If this would take you to an event info page, it would be very useful. We also believe it would be useful for this to be on the map page, as it would allow the user to efficiently see where the event is.  - Severity Rating: 2
It has been suggested that the ability to invite friends to join an event would be a good feature. However, we have already implemented this, it seems it has been overlooked. When creating an event, you can invite friends. This can be seen by following the path Map → Plus symbol (bottom right of page) → Invite friends.  - Severity Rating: 2
We are also adding the name at the top of the chat to make it more clear who you are speaking to.  - Severity Rating: 1
The app seemed to be “boring” because of the lack of color. It seemed simple, clean, but also very plain. For this reason we have decided to add some color into the profile tab!  - Severity Rating: 1
In the profile tab, semesters are categorized only by winter and fall, and not by year. We have decided to fix this by making the sections by title filled by user when they are creating a semester. This also improves the consistency throughout the entire app.  - Severity Rating: 2
Through the evaluation, it was also brought to our attention that a user cannot view or edit the event they have created. To fix this, we have implemented an edit button for the event they have created. The button will be similar to the add new event button, however it will be there to edit their current event.  - Severity Rating: 3
When you are accepting a friend request, you have to click accept and accept once again. It is suggested that we change the second “accept” to “Terry has been accepted a friend!”. We have implemented a similar solution, in which the second accept button is just a label. This also allows for a more modern UI. - Severity Rating: 2


#### Non-functional problems to be fixed before stage 5 deadline
When we navigate to the Broadcast new event page (Map → Plus symbol (bottom right of page)), the “Date” and “Time” sections should be reformatted as “dd/mm/yyyy” and the time as something similar instead of drop downs.   - Severity Rating: 1
The ability to unfriend or block users will be implemented in stage 5 as it is not required for the core functionality of the app. However, it is a feature that should be implemented to allow for a higher level of user control.  - Severity Rating: 2
Feedback suggests that the class dropdown list is confusing. It is unclear if the classes can be chosen. We can see how confusion can arise from this, so we have decided to that for stage 5, we are going to keep the expanding semesters but, we will make the classes are selectable as a filter.  - Severity Rating: 2
When creating a new event, there is little error recognition. We plan to have an error message that tells the user that it failed to create an event if the necessary parameters are not entered. This will be implemented in stage 5.  - Severity Rating: 2
The ability to modify the “About” section on profile is missing. We plan to implement this for our stage 5 deliverable.  - Severity Rating: 3
We may look into implementing a dropdown menu instead of the current button when adding semesters, however, since this is again a non functional issue and more of a stylistic choice it is not necessarily implemented in stage 4.  - Severity Rating: 1
Adding a class is currently only possible under add “add semester” button. We plan on implementing a separate “add class” button to make the feature more available.  - Severity Rating: 2
The “Chat” icon is very similar to the friends icon used in many other apps. It would better represent a match to the real world to change the icon to a more conventional “Chat” icon. We plan on changing this to create a better match between our system and the real world, thus minimizing user confusion.  - Severity Rating: 1

#### Suggestions to be taken into consideration for future projects 
In the “Chat” page, we have two ways we can get to any chat. One is by using the sidebar, and another is by clicking on “message” on the list view. As there are two ways of reaching the same chat, it would be nice if they were ordered differently. For example, the sidebar can be organized by most recently messaged, while the list view is organized in alphabetical order. It was also suggested that it is entirely unnecessary to have both, thus we can consider removing one of them and adding in additional features using that space.  - Severity Rating: 0
It was suggested that the sidebars both on the Map page and the Chat page should be shifted down. This would allow for better error prevention, as a user may accidentally click the volume increase/decrease buttons while reaching for the sidebar.  - Severity Rating: 0
The ability to delete and edit messages. Although this is useful, we don't see this as a necessary feature.  - Severity Rating: 0
Another point that was brought up in the evaluation, was that we had no help and documentation to explain what buttons can be tapped/used.  - Severity Rating: 0
Also a suggestion we are keeping in mind is to allow the user to be able to switch between dark and light modes for the app. This follows the pattern that most current apps and operating systems are now taking. As well, this can not only be visually pleasing for those that require it but can also help in saving battery life.  - Severity Rating: 1
Implementation of an additional screen to confirm a creation/joining of an event. This additional screen should be implemented at the center of the screen as it would allow for additional error prevention. Essentially, it would be harder to misclick something near the middle of the screen as opposed to the bottom. - Severity Rating: 0

## Stage 5
