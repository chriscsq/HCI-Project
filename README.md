# Study Buddy Tinder 
Group project for CPSC 481 (Human Computer Interactions I)

## Stage 1
* Study Buddy Tinder (name pending) is a way for students to be able to connect with other students and find peers to study with. Students may broadcast and join ongoing study sessions, as well as filter their search based on classes that they are currently enrolled in.
* Map feature - Interactive map in which students can see ongoing sessions where they currently are on campus. Students will also be able to see density of zones such as the library or the cafeteria, so they have a general idea of how hard it will be to find a spot before they reach the destination.
* Chat with your buddies! - Students will be able to DM each other, as well as send a chat to groups that are being broadcast. If you are part of a session, you can transfer files to one another as well 

## Stage 2

#### Overview 
Study buddy tinder is a project that focuses on students' ability to meet with other students with the same academic interests. The main features of Study buddy tinder are its broadcasting capabilities, the interactive map, and the messaging system with file transfer. Students have the option of either registering a profile or visiting as a guest. As a guest, students only have the ability to use our universal search feature to find ongoing study sessions and request to join. If students choose to create a student profile, they have access to broadcast ongoing sessions, schedule future sessions, add other profiles to friends, send files to groups or other users. In being able to broadcast and join study sessions, students are able to meet others who are taking the same classes as them, making it easier to meet people. This would come in handy during midterm season, where peer tutoring is high. When registering for a profile, a user can request to be a tutor as well. Tutors will also be able to use the system to advertise their services, which will be shown to students on a tutoring page. This is an easy way to collect tutoring services to students who desire a little bit more of a professional touch, without them having to reach out and look for the correct flyers on campus. Lastly, prep institutions have the ability to contact us to create an account with limited functionality so they can advertise their sessions. A prep institution will be allowed to advertise their future prep sessions on the map. Prep accounts have highly limited functionality, where they can only create future accounts and as well as have open messages in case of student inquiries. Students who see the prep session on the map can click on it and choose to hide graphic, or to register for the session.

#### IDEO Methods
* To gauge user interest, we chose to survey the Univeristy of Calgary subreddit. This survey provided us with the information that despite most people studying alone, they are open to the idea of meeting with new peers. In addition, students are already comfortable with using forms of technology to communicate with other students (Reddit, Slack, Discord etc), introduction to an app would not shock the culture.

* To get more detailed data, we also gave a more in depth interview to see how their studying habits have changed since University. After learning a bit more, we offered these students 3 scenario cards which depicted 2 traditional scenes of finding new study partners, and one scene which involved the use of our app. We asked them what features seemed the most interesting to them, and the general consensus was the ability to build an academic social network with an interactive map appealed most of them.
